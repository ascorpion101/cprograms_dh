**Smart Home Solution with Authentication and Authorization**

To design a smart home solution with authentication and authorization features, we need to consider the best security practices. Here is a high-level overview of how we can achieve this:

1. **User Registration**: Implement a user registration system where users can create their accounts by providing necessary credentials such as username, password, and email.

2. **Password Hashing**: Store passwords in hashed form using a strong hashing algorithm like bcrypt or Argon2. This ensures that even if the database is compromised, it would be extremely difficult to retrieve the original passwords.

3. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Implement 2FA for an extra layer of security. Users can verify their identity using methods like SMS codes, authenticator apps, or physical security keys.

4. **Secure Communication**: Ensure secure communication between the smart home devices and the central server. Use protocols like HTTPS and TLS/SSL for encryption and secure data transfer.

5. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implement RBAC to manage different levels of access. Assign roles such as administrator, family member, guest, etc., and define which actions each role can perform within the smart home system.

6. **Access Tokens**: Use access tokens instead of storing permanent passwords or API keys on devices. Issue short-lived access tokens with limited permissions, and revoke them when no longer needed.

7. **Device Authentication**: Each smart home device should have its own unique identifier and authenticate itself with the central server before interacting with any user data. This prevents unauthorized devices from accessing the system.

8. **Secure Device-to-Device Communication**: If there is a need for device-to-device communication, ensure it is encrypted and authenticated to maintain confidentiality and integrity.

9. **Regular Software Updates**: Keep all devices and the central server up to date with the latest firmware and security patches.

10. **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement monitoring and logging systems to track suspicious activities, identify potential security breaches, and investigate any issues that may arise.

11. **Vulnerability Assessments**: Periodically conduct vulnerability assessments and penetration testing to identify and address security loopholes before they can be exploited.

12. **Secure Remote Access**: If remote access is required, use Virtual Private Network (VPN) or other secure tunneling methods to establish a secure connection to the smart home system.

By following these best security practices, we can design a smart home solution with strong authentication and authorization features, ensuring the privacy and security of the users' data and devices.
